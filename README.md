# Deep Learning for Auto-Generated Music Composition

## Introduction
This work is the final project for NYU Deep Learning course.
- This work is based on the DeepJ model from the github repository [DeepJ: A model for style-specific music generation](https://github.com/calclavia/DeepJ) with some modifications.
- The reference paper is [Mao HH, Shin T, Cottrell G. DeepJ: Style-specific music generation. In2018 IEEE 12th International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC) 2018 Jan 31 (pp. 377-382). IEEE.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00887).
